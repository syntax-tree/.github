# [![syntax-tree][githubusercontent-logo]][github-syntax-tree]

**`syntax-tree`** is an organization that contains 100+ projects that deal with
syntax trees based on **[unist][github-unist]**.
These trees typically deal with content:
markdown (**[mdast][github-mdast]**),
HTML (**[hast][github-hast]**),
natural language (**[nlcst][github-nlcst]**),
XML (**[xast][github-xast]**),
but also JavaScript (**[esast][github-esast]**).

* to learn unist,
  see [its readme][github-unist]
* you can use syntax trees without having to deal with them,
  by using **[unified][github-unified]** and its plugins

#### unified

**`syntax-tree`** is part of the unified collective,
which brings together organisations that work with content as structured data.
