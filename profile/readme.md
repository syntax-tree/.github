# [![syntax-tree][logo]][org]

**`syntax-tree`** is an organization that contains 100+ projects that deal with
syntax trees based on **[unist][]**.
These trees typically deal with content:
markdown (**[mdast][]**),
HTML (**[hast][]**),
natural language (**[nlcst][]**),
XML (**[xast][]**),
but also JavaScript (**[esast][]**).

* to learn unist,
  see [its readme][unist]
* you can use syntax trees without having to deal with them,
  by using **[unified][]** and its plugins

#### unified

**`syntax-tree`** is part of the unified collective,
which brings together organisations that work with content as structured data.
