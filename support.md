### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for us to help.
Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when youâ€™re
close to a problem.
Then,
those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

* try to define what you need help with:
  * is there something in particular you want to do?
  * what problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
    and fix it?
  * is there a concept youâ€™re not understanding?
* learn about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck]
* avoid falling for the [XY problem][xy]
* search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked
* if possible,
  provide sample code,
  a [CodeSandbox][],
  or a video
* the more time you put into asking your question,
  the better we can help you
